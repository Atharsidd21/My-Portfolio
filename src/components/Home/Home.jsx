        Hi, Iâ€™m a passionate game developer with a love for coding, gaming, and traveling. Throughout my learning journey, I have honed my skills in Unity, Unreal Engine, C#, and C++. My primary focus lies in developing innovative and engaging games, and I'm always eager to explore new techniques and technologies within the game development industry. I am constantly learning to refine my craft, experimenting with different game mechanics, and staying updated on industry trends. My ultimate dream is to be part of a AAA game project, like Grand Theft Auto, where I can contribute to creating immersive, high-quality experiences for players.
